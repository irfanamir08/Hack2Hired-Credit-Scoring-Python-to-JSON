# Hack2Hired-Credit-Scoring-Python-to-JSON
This project was done by me( Izzat Amar) , Irfan Amir and Ammar Syatbi during Hack2Hired Software Hackathon. The challenge was provided by Experian. We were assigned to process a loan dataset and select customers who should receive a promotion based on their credit performance.

The results of processing in Python is converted into JSON so that it may be displayed in web.
